            abstract: "Oil Pollution is the resultant contamination of environment due to the presence of oil in excessive quantity. Oil contamination is a genuine danger to our environment and biological community and should be controlled with urgency. The oil contamination is influencing the geotechnical properties of soil. So, itâ€™s a need to study the effect of diesel oil on geotechnical properties of soils. In this study, the variation of geotechnical properties like Atterberg limits and unconfined compressive strength with the addition of diesel oil in clay was considered. For Removal of Contaminated oil adding EDTA at thrice the oil content. After removal of oil content further adding glass fiber for the strength characteristics. The results showed that increase in the amount of diesel oil decreases the Atterberg limits and unconfined compressive strength. Increasing diesel oil content will leads to decrease in strength and settlement. For that EDTA was best remedial measures for removing oil content\n keyWord:Oil pollution, geotechnical properties, Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength, diesel oil.
